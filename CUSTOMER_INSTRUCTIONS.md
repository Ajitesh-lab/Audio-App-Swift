## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I share this with my friends/family?**
A: Each license key works for one account only. If they want the app, they need to purchase their own license key. However, you can use your account on 2 devices (like your iPhone and iPad).

**Q: I lost my password, what do I do?**
A: Contact me with your email address and I'll help you reset it.

**Q: I got a new phone, can I switch devices?**
A: Yes! If you've already used your 2 devices, contact me and I'll help you remove an old device so you can add your new one.

**Q: My license key says "already used"**
A: This means you or someone else already created an account with this key. If you already registered, just login with your email and password instead. If someone else used your key, contact me immediately.

**Q: Can I use this on iPad?**
A: Yes! Install the app on your iPad and login with your email and password.

**Q: What if I delete the app?**
A: No problem! Your account and all your downloads are saved on the server. Just reinstall the app and login with your email and password.

**Q: Do downloads cost money?**
A: No! Once you purchase the app, you can download unlimited songs for free. No subscriptions, no hidden costs.
